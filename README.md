# Star Wars Planet Explorer

A minimal app built using SvelteKit that allows users to see a list of all planets in the Star Wars universe and explore their details (uses SWAPI for data). The planet details shows basic info about the planet, plus geology data, the names of all characters from the planet, and all films the planet is featured in.

Fun fact: I generally only build backends & this is my first time using Svelte ðŸ˜®

## Demo

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Speed Insights

Once deployed on Vercel, you can benefit from [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/speed-insights) simply by navigating to Vercel's dashboard, clicking on the 'Speed Insights' tab, and enabling the product.

You will get data once your application will be re-deployed and will receive visitors.
